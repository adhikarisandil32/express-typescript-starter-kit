# About Express Typescript Starter Kit

Sometimes starting an express project in typescript can be a huge pain. To serve you as a painkiller, I being you `express-typescript-starter-kit`. You have to do noting, just clone the project and you're ready to go. Most of the time you don't even need to move out of `src` directory of the project. Here is what it will provide you out of the box:

- Clean Import - Provides path aliases, as you can see on `tsconfig.json`, you can add/remove them as per your need. It will automatically resolve during the build.
- A good prettier configuration so that when more then one of you are working, your own workspace definition won't cause needless changes to the file just by saving it.
- A config where you configure all your environment variables and then pass it to the rest of the app.
- Initiliztion setup of API Documentation - Swagger using json and an example file on how to document APIs using json file (Learn More About Them [Here](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/about/) and Practice Them [Here](https://editor.swagger.io/))

Here is how you can initialize the project.

- Install all the dependencies using `pnpm i`
